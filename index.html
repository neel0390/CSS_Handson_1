    <h2>CSS can be added in HTML document in 3 Ways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="letter-spacing: 5px">
        Inline - by using a style attribute inside HTML elements
      </li>
      <li id="my-styles3">
        Internal- by using a style attribute in head section
      </li>
      <li id="my-styles4">
        External- by using a link element to link external CSS file
      </li>
      <li id="my-styles5">
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in External css
        files. However,<span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow"
          >in This tutorial we use inline and internal styles</span
        >, beacause it is easier to demonstrate. easier to you try it yourself
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color: brown">
      When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
      unique element, ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
      link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript
    </p>
    <p style="color: brown">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p style="color: brown">
      There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly
      used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style
      should be applied.
